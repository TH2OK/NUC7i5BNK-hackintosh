# NUC7I5BNK Hackintosh

This is my "working" config for my day-to-day use. Some things are not important to me hence they aren't fixed. Should be a great starting point for someone that does want all features to work. Currently running 12.4 Monterey

# Hardware Config

 - Intel i5-7260U (4) @ 2.20GHz
 - Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640
 - 8GB DDR4
 - 250GB WD Blue SSD

## Working

 - GPU
 - Sleep
 - Wireless (via HeliPort)
 - Bluetooth
 - Back USB
 - Front USB**
 - Imessage

** For some reason only storage devices are picked up. My keyboard/mouse won't work plugged in to the front USB.
## Not Working

 - No DRM (no Netflix playback in safari, working fine in edge/chrome)
 - No Audio via 3.5mm Jack
 - USB-C Thunderbolt is probably not working, don't have anything to test.
 - Front USB?
 - HDMI Audio out? Don't have a display with speakers.
